*** Version 1.5.2 (2022-02-26) ***
This version fixes some important bugs and adds features to
enhance productivity and further improve topological data quality.
The focus of this release is on improving the flexibility and
reliability of automated topological data corrections.

NOTE 1: It is now possible to directly turn on/off sets of topological
cleaning operations (see Changelog). Higher-level cleaning functions
remain untested for lat/lon data. The software will issue a warning
in such cases.

NOTE 2: Two 1.5.1 BETA versions were released prior to this version.
Therefore, additional changes are covered in the change log notes of
these versions. No official version 1.5.1 (final) was ever released.

Changelog:
- New feature: Option "--topology=" controls topological cleaning level.
- Bug fix: Insert line/boundary intersection points in correct order.
- Bug fix: Prevent polygon boundaries from snapping onto themselves.
- Bug fix: Fix crash when snapping boundaries of multi-part polygons.
- Bug fix: Fix crash when cropping overlap areas of multi-part polygons.
- Bug fix: Completely crop all overlap areas of multi-part polygons.
- Improvement: Overlap correction for polygons now much more zealous.
- Improvement: Issue a warning if duplicate vertices appear after snapping.
- Docs: Added advice on extreme topological case of crossing polygons.
