# FAQs

## How do I install this software?

Look into the folder "bin". In it, you will find subfolders
for the different operating systems that we support. Pick the
one that matches your OS. There is another "README" file in
that folder that has specific instructions for your OS.
Make sure to read it, as it may list some important 3rd
party software that you need to install before being able
to run survey2gis.

Also note that there are two versions of survey2gis for each OS.
The version in the OS folder itself contains a graphical user
interface (GUI. The subfolder "cli-only" contains a version
without a GUI that is more light-weight and suitable for use
from the command line/terminal window (CLI) only.

Just run "survey2gis[.exe]" to start the program.


## How do I use this software?

Just start the "survey2gis" executable and it will come up with a
graphical user interface. If you have chosen to run the CLI only
version (see above), then you can issue the following command
for a short summary of CLI syntax options:

```
 survey2gis -h
```

Detailed instructions can be found in the user manual that came with
this software.
